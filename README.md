```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to when I started my learning journey
```

```
GIVEN the Quiz app

WHEN the user clicks on the "start" button,
THEN a timer starts and the first question appears
